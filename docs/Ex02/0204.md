## Update Microsoft 365 Apps for Windows 10 or later assignments
    
If you're deploying Microsoft 365 Apps with Intune using the Microsoft 365 Apps for Windows 10 and later app, the channel selected in the app configuration is re-evaluated and enforced during policy refresh. If the channels don't match, this causes unexpected channel flipping under the following circumstances:

Deploying Microsoft 365 Apps using the Microsoft 365 Apps for Windows 10 and later app.

- The app is configured using the Configuration designer.
- The app is assigned as required.
- The selected channel differs from the newly assigned one.
    
If this matches your current configuration, adjust your Microsoft 365 Apps for Windows 10 or later apps:
    
- Update the configuration of the existing app to exclude the Microsoft Entra ID security groups you created for the channel change.
- Create new Microsoft 365 Apps for Windows 10 or later apps with the newly assigned update channel.
    
If you're moving devices to both Current and Monthly Enterprise Channel, you have to create two new apps. Assign the newly created apps to the respective Microsoft Entra ID security groups.
