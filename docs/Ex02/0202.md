{: .warning }
> It might take up to 24 hours for the channel change to be completed by the device, assuming devices are online and can connect to the service. 

{: .important }
> A channel change is a point-in-time activity. If you are using Microsoft Entra ID groups and add devices or users to the group after initiating a channel change, those devices will not be moved automatically. You will have to initiate the channel change again. There's no need to remove already switched devices from the group. 
> You can validate the implementation by monitoring the following aspects: 
> - Within 24 hours, you should see the devices being listed in the Monthly Enterprise or Current profile. 
> - Within 24 hours, you should see the Update Channel changing to the targeted one in inventory. 
> - On the device, the following registry key should change to "1", as profile's control is established on the device: 
> - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\cloud\office\16.0\Common\officeupdate > IgnoreGPO 
> - Other apps like Visio, Project or Access Runtime are migrated to Current Channel as well and are updated in the same pass.
