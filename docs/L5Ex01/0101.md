# Task 5.1: Search the audit log for Copilot interactions in Microsoft Purview

When auditing Copilot interactions, Microsoft Purview Audit captures detailed events including user interactions with Copilot, the Microsoft 365 service where the activity occurred, and references to any accessed files stored in Microsoft 365. If these files have sensitivity labels, this information is also recorded. To search for these interactions:

1. Sign into the **[Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft Purview compliance portal")**.

1. On the left navigation, under **Solutions**, select **Audit**.

1. Select **New Search**.

1. If necessary, select **Start recording user and admin activity**.

1. Configure your search on the **New Search** tab:

    1. Set the **Start date** and **End date** for your search.

    1. Enter relevant keywords or phrases in the **Keyword Search**.

        {: .highlight }
        > Use asterisks (*) to replace special characters.

    1. Select administrative units from the **Admin Units** dropdown if needed.

    1. Under **Activities - friendly names**, search for **Copilot activities** and select **Interacted with Copilot**.

        {: .note }
        > For precise searches, use **Activities - operations names** and enter *CopilotInteraction* as the operation name for Copilot activities.

    1. On the **Record types** dropdown menu, search for **Copilot** and then select **CopilotInteraction**.

    1. Name your search in the **Search name** field for easy identification.

    1. Enter specific users in the **Users** field or leave it blank to return entries for all users (and service accounts) in your organization.

    1. Enter **File**, **folder**, or **site** names for targeted searches or leave this box blank to return entries for all files and folders in your organization.

1. Select **Search** to start your search job. 

{: .highlight }
> A maximum of 10 search jobs can be run in parallel for one user account. If a user requires more than 10 search jobs, they must wait for an *In progress* job to finish or delete a search job.

> ## Limitations and considerations for auditing Copilot interactions
>
When implementing compliance management solutions for Copilot in Microsoft 365, it's important to be aware of the limitations and considerations:
>
- **Scope of auditing**: Auditing captures the occurrence of Copilot activities, such as search events, but doesn't record the actual user prompts or responses. For detailed interaction data, eDiscovery tools should be used.
>
- **Admin-related changes exclusion**: Changes related to Copilot administration, such as configuration adjustments, aren't currently captured in the auditing logs.
>
- **Device Identity Information**: Device identity information, which can be important for comprehensive auditing, isn't included in the audit details for Copilot activities.
>
**Application-specific limitations:**
>
- **Copilot in Teams**: When transcripts are turned off, auditing capabilities for Copilot interactions aren't supported. Actions involving referencing transcripts aren't captured in the audit logs.
>
- **Identification of Source App**: The source of Copilot interactions is identified by the app name in the audit logs, such as Copilot in Word or Copilot in Teams.
